## JavaScript Basics: From Easy to Optimal Code

Welcome to my JavaScript test project! In this repository, I explore various JavaScript concepts while gradually enhancing my coding skills. The project showcases a step-by-step evolution of code from the easy and straightforward approach, to leveraging built-in functions and advanced data structures for more optimal solutions.

## Learning Process

#### Easy Way Code:

At first, I started by writing code in a simple and straightforward manner. This allowed me to understand the fundamental logic and structure of the problem. While this approach may not be the most efficient, it helped me grasp the core concepts of JavaScript.

#### Learning Inbuilt Functions:

As I progressed, I dived into JavaScript's built-in functions and methods. Understanding these powerful tools enabled me to streamline my code and make it more concise and efficient.

#### Exploring JavaScript Data Structures:

I also dedicated time to learn about various data structures in JavaScript, such as arrays, objects, and maps. Utilizing these data structures allowed me to organize and manipulate data more effectively.

## Optimal Way Code

Finally, after familiarizing myself with JavaScript's inbuilt functions and data structures, I rewrote the code in an optimal way. This approach leverages the full potential of JavaScript, resulting in faster, cleaner, and more maintainable code.
